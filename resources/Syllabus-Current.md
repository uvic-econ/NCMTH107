## Description

The objective of this course is to introduce students to the use of operations research
for solving policy problems. Operations research is a broad set of computational tools. We will
consider traditional mathematical programming models (e.g., LP, NLP, integer programming),
but extend these to include multiple-objective, compromise, risk, fuzzy and bi-level
programming. If time permits, we will also examine dynamic optimization methods, including
deterministic and stochastic dynamic programming. The focus is on applications to real world
problems and numerical solutions. Students will be expected to learn GAMS and some other
program, preferably R, how to interface them and how to link to Excel.

## Learning Outcomes

Students successfully completing the course will be able to distinguish
primal and dual problems in economics and understand the underlying symmetry. They will be
able to develop and solve certain types of real-world, constrained optimization models, most
particularly small- and large-scale linear programming models. They should also be able to
program rudimentary problems in R and GAMS. Finally, students should have a better
understanding of how to structure economic problems computationally.
